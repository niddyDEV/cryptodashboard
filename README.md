## Design inspiration
Looking for some drafts for designing this app in the Internet I have decided few key things, that I want to represent in such project.

1. Contrast colors - **white** and **black**.  

2. Domenant feeling of **digitalization** - pixels and sharp forms. Main font family is **Pixelify Sans**. Triangle figure as a tenet of blockchain axioms: *scalability*, *security* and *transparency*.

3. Straight sourse of insipration - **Black Barrier** from Cyberpunk 2077 game. Visualisation of big data through *long lines*, *pixalization point of view* and *deep unknown space* that refers to **anonymity**.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
